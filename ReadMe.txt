**** HOW TO RUN IT **************************************

	Run SCP - Containment Breach.exe in the game folder.

	SCP-CB uses an engine called Blitz3D, and since it's a fairly outdated one,
	you might run into problems when trying to run it on newer systems.

	If you're getting an error such as "Memory Access Violation" or
	"Unable to set graphics mode" when launching the game, try the following:

	- Run the game as administrator
	- Make sure your graphics card drivers are up-to-date
	- Try different resolutions and running the game in full screen

	- Don't repeatedly interact with the same object, lever, button, or keycard reader
