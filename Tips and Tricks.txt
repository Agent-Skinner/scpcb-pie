I assume you are here because you are stuck in the game, no?
Well, you came to the right place. 

How to beat the game - 

You will start the game in the Light Containment Zone, the very lowest 
level of the facility. If you enable the intro sequence, then you will 
see the breach firsthand. If not, then quick summary: Maxwell Acachalla
escaped right in front of your eyes and the facility has entered full 
lockdown. From here you will need to flee quickly and find a keycard and
some other useful items. Some tips for while you go about this:

- Maxwell can only move or attack you if you break your line of sight with
him
- Blink before you open doors
- Check corners
- Get a keycard at all costs
- Get a gas mask, S-Nav, medkit, and night vision goggles
- Get a clipboard to hold documents and a wallet to hold keycards and quarters

After you obtain a Paid Intern/Level 2 keycard, you will be able to enter 
914's chambers. From here you will be able to upgrade your items with the
"1:1" "Fine" and "Very Fine" settings. Some tips while you are in this room:

-Upgrade your keycard(s) to Full Member/Level 3
-Upgrade your gas mask (if obtained)
-Upgrade your night vision goggles (if obtained)
-Upgrade your S-Nav 300 (if obtained) until you get the S-Nav Ultimate
-Upgrade the Medkit in the room to a "Small First Aid Kit"

Once you have a Full Member keycard, you can leave the Light Containment Zone.
First, however, you will need to find the Surveillence room and disable the 
Light Containment Zone Lockdown. This will allow you to transverse the 
checkpoint(s) to the Heavy Containment Zone. Make sure you are done with the 
Light Containment Zone (get all items you want) and then leave. Once you enter
the Heavy Containment Zone, you will need to find the macaroni containment unit.

Once you find this room, you will need to close the macaroni valve while keeping
from inhaling the macaroni fumes. This will allow you to exit the Heavy 
Containment Zone.
